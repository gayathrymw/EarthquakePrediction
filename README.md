# Python For ML<br />
# Earthquake Prediction<br />
Earthquake Prediction is a way of predicting magnitude of earthquake based on parameters such as longitude, latitude, depth, and duration magnitude, country, depth using machine learning to give warning of potentially damaging earthquakes early enough to allow appropriate response to the disaster, enabling people to minimize loss of life and property.<br />
The steps we have taken here are:<br />
     Preprocessing of Dataset<br />
     Building ML models such as Linear Regression, Decission Tree, KNN<br />
     Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn<br />
With the help of Python and suitable machine learning algorithms, we can create prediction models and graph the data as we want.<br />
